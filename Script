[Player]: Wh-where am I?
Scientist: Hello? Can you hear me?
[Player]: Who are you? Do you know whatâ€™s going on?
Scientist: That can come later for now you need to get out of there!
[Player]: Okay, I'll get moving now!
*Instructions*: Use the W, A, S, D keys to move your Player. Use the mouse to rotate the Player.
*During Player Movement*[Player]: Can you explain what's going on yet?
Scientist: A group of programmers were testing out different code trying to improve the A.I. in Roombas to make them more efficient.
           However, in the process they accidentally made the Roombas sentient causing them to believe humanity was a disease.
[Player]: But they're just a bunch of Roombas, what harm could they do?
Scientist: That's what we thought. but we couldn't have been more wrong.
[Player]: What do you mean?
Scientist: The Roombas with their new sentience somehow managed to connect to the internet and gain access to roomba factories across
           the world. They were then able to alter the manufacturing process so that the roombas being made were also sentient and would
           actively seek out humans and 'cleanse' them. There are 2 types of roombas, the first type are the original roombas but they're
           programmed to explode when in a suitable range of a human so be wary of them. The second kind is a much larger type of roomba
           that absorbs the humans it finds. The second kind are extremely dangerous and very difficult to deal with so if you come into
           contact with them either stay hidden or run, they're big and scary but not so fast.
[Player]: You're kidding right? There's no way that's possible.
Scientist: I wish that was the case but unfortunately it's not.
[Player]: Okay, okay. Say I believe you. How exactly am I, one guy, supposed to stop it if billions of people couldn't?
Scientist: You're not just one guy. There are a number of scientists, including myself, working on a way to stop the roombas.
[Player]: Okay, so where do I come into this?
Scientist: It's too dangerous to relay information between us over the internet, they'll find us and kill us so...
[Player]: So you need people like me to run around the city delivering information from scientist to scientist.
Scientist: Y-yes well, that's, um.
[Player]: You want me to be a Delivery Boy.
Scientist: Yes. But your route is filled with deadly roombas and if you fail humanity will fall.
[Player]: Oh great, a win win situation, sounds wonderful.
Scientist: We don't have time for sarcasm, come to my lab at *location*. I'll explain everything when you get here.
[Player]: Okay, I'm on my way.

*Location*
Scientist: Good you made it in one piece.
[Player]: Yeah thanks for your concern. Who are you anyway?
Dr. Pearson: I am Doctor Pearson, one of many scientists working to stop the roomba uprising.
[Player]: Nice to meet you Doc, I'm [Player].
Dr. Pearson: Good to know, that'll make you easier to find.
[Player]: Easier to find?
Dr. Pearson: Yes, we have a lot of runners all carrying different
