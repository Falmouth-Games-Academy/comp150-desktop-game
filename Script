[Player]: Wh-where am I?
Scientist: Hello? Can you hear me?
[Player]: Who are you? Do you know whats going on?
Scientist: That can come later for now you need to get out of there!
[Player]: Okay, I'll get moving now!
*Inscrutions*: Use the W, A, S, D keys to move your Player. Use the mouse to rotate the Player.
*During Player Movement*[Player]: Can you explain what's going on yet?
Scientist: A group of programmers were testing out different code trying to improve the A.I. in Roombas to make them more efficient.
           However in the process they accidentally made the Roombas sentient causing them to believe humanity was a desiease.
[Player]: But their just a bunch of Roombas, What harm could they do?
Scientist: Thats what we thought. but we couldn't have been more wrong.
[Player]: How do you mean?
Scientist: The Roombas with their new sentience somehow managed to connect to the internet and gain access to roomba factories accross
           the world. They were then able to alter the manufacturing process so that thr roombas being made were also sentient and would
           actively seek out humans and blow up when close enough.
[Player]: You're kidding right? There's no way that's possible.
Scientist: I wish that was the case but unfortunatly it's not.
