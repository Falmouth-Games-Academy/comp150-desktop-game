# COMP110 Coding Task 2 - Game Component

##Proposal
I intend to create a procedural level generator for our COMP150 game.
It will include:
* Generating the level layout so that it is appropriate for the game, that is, a maze of rooms that isn't overly complicated
* Placing Doctors and Guards in appropriate positions
* Placing the exit in an appropriate position
* Placing collectable items in appropriate positions
* Placing doors and locked doors in appropriate positions
* Ensuring that keycards are placed on the correct side of locked doors
