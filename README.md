The player moves with the mouse and by holding right-click, the player can move the camera within the top-down Warcraft-like world where you can see what is ahead of the pillar/village to spot any attacks or potential resource fountains. 

The game will operate on a hexagon field with each town building type i.e. inn, residence, barn and etc. residing within their own hexagon. The quest status bar will always be on the player's screen to remind them of the task that needs to be done for progression. Completed tasks will be matched with a tick and the incomplete ones will remain on the screeen.

Pillars


[Play]
[Save/Load]
[Options]
[Exit]

After the [Play] button has been pressed, the game will then prompt "Easy, Medium and Hard difficulties".
